# 🛠️ **Cloud Burst - Development Roadmap**
📊 Overall Project Completion: ~55% [Beta Focus]
📅 February 27, 2024
Version: 0.1.13

## 📌 Situational Abstract
Following successful restoration and deployment optimization, Cloud Burst has pivoted to a streamlined beta approach. The project has achieved stable authentication, optimized Replit deployment, and simplified architecture within memory constraints. This strategic reset positions us to focus on essential beta features while maintaining platform reliability.

With the system now stable and deployed at cb-beta.replit.app, Cloud Burst is positioned to accelerate feature development. The simplified architecture has proven reliable, and our deployment pipeline is working efficiently. Focus is now on implementing core features while maintaining current stability.
