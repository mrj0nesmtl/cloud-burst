# Session Sequence Context: Deployment Priority Shift
📅 February 23, 2025

## 🔄 Sequence Adjustment
During the implementation of our authentication and dashboard systems, we encountered critical deployment issues that require immediate attention. This has led to a strategic pivot in our session sequence:

- Session 13 (Current): Deployment Stabilization
- Session 14 (Renamed from 12): Auth Testing & Dashboard & Photo Upload Implementation

## 🎯 Strategic Decision
While we've made significant progress with authentication (75%) and settings (75%), deploying these features has revealed infrastructure challenges that must be addressed before proceeding with the dashboard implementation. This isn't a setback, but rather a necessary pause to strengthen our foundation.

### Why This Matters
1. **Infrastructure First**: A stable deployment environment is crucial for testing protected routes and real-time features
2. **Authentication Integrity**: Our auth system needs a production-ready environment to properly validate security measures
3. **Development Efficiency**: Resolving these issues now prevents compounded problems when implementing the dashboard

## 🛣️ Path Forward
1. **Session 13**: Focus entirely on deployment stabilization
   - Node.js 20.x configuration
   - Package dependency resolution
   - Build process optimization
   - Environment configuration

2. **Session 14** (Previously Session 12): Resume planned features
   - Dashboard implementation
   - Photo upload system
   - Protected routes
   - Real-time features

## 📈 Impact on Timeline
This strategic pause for deployment fixes is expected to:
- Add 1-2 days to our immediate timeline
- Save 3-4 days of potential issues during dashboard implementation
- Improve overall system reliability
- Enhance deployment automation

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. Complete deployment stabilization (Session 13)
2. Verify production environment
3. Resume dashboard implementation (Session 14)
4. Continue with planned feature rollout

This temporary pivot ensures we're building on a solid foundation, ultimately accelerating our path to a production-ready platform.
