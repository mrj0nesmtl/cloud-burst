# Session 15 - Feature Implementation & User Flows
📅 February 24, 2024 | v0.1.12

## 📋 Situational Abstract
Following the successful system restoration to v0.1.9 (commit aa97880) and subsequent stabilization, we're now positioned to resume feature development. Our simplified beta architecture has proven more resilient, particularly in the Replit deployment environment. With core systems stable, we can focus on implementing essential features for the beta release.

## 🎯 Primary Objectives
1. Authentication & User Roles
   - [ ] Complete login/signup flows
   - [ ] Implement role-based access (Event Organizer, Guest)
   - [ ] Session management
   - [ ] Protected route handling

2. Photo Gallery System
   - [ ] Basic gallery component
   - [ ] Upload functionality
   - [ ] Image optimization
   - [ ] Gallery view modes

3. QR Code Integration
   - [ ] QR code generation
   - [ ] Event linking system
   - [ ] QR code scanning flow
   - [ ] Access validation

4. User Flows Implementation
   - [ ] Event Organizer dashboard
   - [ ] Guest photo viewing
   - [ ] Public landing experience
   - [ ] Event creation wizard

## 🛠️ Technical Focus
- Maintain memory optimization (512MB limit)
- Progressive image loading
- Efficient state management
- Type-safe implementations
- Mobile-first responsive design
