# Development Status Notes
📅 *Updated: Feb 2024*

## 🎯 Current Status

We have successfully established the foundational architecture for Cloud Capture, with comprehensive documentation and component planning in place. Our initial focus has been on structuring the project properly, implementing Shadcn/UI components, and planning user flows. The documentation phase has given us a clear roadmap for implementation.

Key accomplishments:
- ✅ Project structure and architecture defined
- ✅ Component library (Shadcn/UI) integration planned
- ✅ User flows and authentication paths documented
- ✅ Documentation structure established
- ✅ Technical stack decisions finalized

## 🚀 Next Development Phase

### 1. Authentication Implementation
- Set up Supabase authentication
- Implement social login providers
- Create guest access flow
- Design and implement auth UI components
- Set up protected routes

### 2. Core Website Structure
- Build landing page with hero section
- Implement responsive navigation
- Create authentication pages (login/register)
- Set up layout components
- Implement theme switching

### 3. Photo Management Foundation
- Create upload interface
- Implement file handling
- Set up Supabase storage
- Create gallery view components
- Implement basic AI processing pipeline

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. Initialize Supabase project and configure auth
2. Create auth context and hooks
3. Build landing page with navigation
4. Implement protected route middleware
5. Set up basic user profile management

## 🔍 Technical Focus Areas
- Type safety across all implementations
- Proper error handling and boundaries
- Performance optimization from the start
- Comprehensive testing setup
- Accessibility compliance
- Security best practices

## 📝 Notes for Next Session
Our next development session should focus on authentication implementation and core website structure. We'll need to:
1. Set up Supabase client
2. Create authentication context
3. Build auth UI components
4. Implement protected routes
5. Create landing page layout

Remember to maintain strict TypeScript usage and follow our established component patterns throughout the implementation.
